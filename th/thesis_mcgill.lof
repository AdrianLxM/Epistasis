The GO executable invokes main BDS, written in JAVA, performs lexing, parsing, compilation to AST and runs AST. (C) When the task statement is run, appropriate checks are performed. (D) A shell script \texttt {task1.sh} is created, and a bds-exec process is fired. (E) bds-exec reports PID, executed the script \texttt {task1.sh} while capturing stdout and stderr as well as monitoring timeouts and OS signals. When a process finishes execution, the exit status is logged\relax }}{52}
